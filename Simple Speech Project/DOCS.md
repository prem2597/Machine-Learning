# Extracting Speech from Video using Python

- We will be using Google Speech Recognition library.

- Speech Rercognition is a popular topic under machine learning concepts.

- The Sub titles that we see on Netflix shows or Youtube videos are created mostly by machines using artificial intelligence.

- We will be using a library called MoviePy & SpeechRecognition.

- MoviePy is a library that can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF. If you are having issues when installing moviepy library, try by installing ffmpeg. Ffmpeg is a leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.

- Video to audio conversion

    - In this step, we will something really cool, which is converting our video recording into an audio file. There are many video formats, some of them can be listed as:

        MP4 (mp4, m4a, m4v, f4v, f4a, m4b, m4r, f4b, mov)
        3GP (3gp, 3gp2, 3g2, 3gpp, 3gpp2)
        OGG (ogg, oga, ogv, ogx)
        WMV (wmv, wma, asf*)

    - We should know our video’s format to do the conversion without any problem. Besides the video format, it’s also a good practice to know some audio formats. Here are some of them:

        MP3
        AAC
        WMA
        AC3 (Dolby Digital)
